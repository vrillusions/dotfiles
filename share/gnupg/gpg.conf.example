# Even better, hide the encrytion to yourself. Using just encrypt-to it's
# possible to guess that one of those keys is the sender of the message. With
# hidden-encrypt-to all that will be known is the recipients key and yours will
# just show up as all zeros

# The import-clean in the next two options removes all signatures that are not
# usable to you, this includes keys that are not in your keychain. This means
# if a key has 100s of signatures they will be removed if they are unknown to
# you.  This may raise alarms if you expect a key to have 100s of signatures
# and see hardly any.

# Unless you don't want to use a keyserver at all, this is a good option to
# have on. Commenting out can speed up certain operations though

# This version turns on several other options. The two clean options helps keep
# the keyring from getting filled up with expired signatures
keyserver-options include-subkeys include-revoked import-clean export-clean
# To add auto-key-retrieve add it to the end (only a single keyserver-options
# line can exist)

# When importing a key manually, also clean up signatures
import-options import-clean

# Another usability option. If you encrypt for an email address not in your
# local keyring it will search in this order:
#   - DNS CERT, per http://www.josefsson.org/rfc2538bis (published as RFC4398)
#   - DNS PKA, not in RFC but referred to a lot on gpg sites
#   - what we have defined in "keyservers" option(s)
# Leaving disabled because this could slow things down a lot (DNS CERT stores
# the entire public key in dns record and DNS PKA gives a url to fetch the
# public key from)
#auto-key-locate cert pka keyserver

# Additional PKA options (again leaving disabled but again useful options that
# can reduce the amount of "unknown user" messages you'll see.
#   - pka-lookups - This will do a DNS PKA lookup to verify the sender. Since
#     this isn't popular it could needless slow things down.
#   - pka-trust-increase - If pka lookup succeeds (this option requires pka-
#     lookups) then raise the trust of the signature to full.
# Again left commented out since for most people this wastes time
#verify-options pka-lookups pka-trust-increase

# These next three settings are important and should be setup before creating

# this to match how the docs describe ordering this (cipher, hash, then

# This sets the preferences on all new keys. You can modify preferences on
