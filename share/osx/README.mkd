## Script folders

The two application folders should be symlinked to ~/Library/ like so (assuming the folders don't exist already)

    ln -s ~/dotfiles/share/osx/Application\ Scripts ~/Library/
    ln -s ~/dotfiles/share/osx/Scripts ~/Library/

In general the application scripts tend to be specialized for a particular application.  When you use an application subfolder in scripts then your basically just saying you only ever use that script on a certain application.
