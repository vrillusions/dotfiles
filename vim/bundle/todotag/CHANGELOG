0.2.0 - 2013-11-04
==================

- Renamed to "todotag" and moved to it's own project. (Was previously called
  "todo_comment" and was located directly in my ~/.vim/plugin folder
- Because of name change you will need to rename `g:todo_comment_owner` to
  `g:todotag_owner`.
- `strftime("%F")` didn't work in windows.
- Known Issue (gh-1): On occasion the buffer-scope variable doesn't get set.
  It's been difficult to reproduce though. Fix is in place while I figure it
  out.

0.1.0 - 2013-10-28
